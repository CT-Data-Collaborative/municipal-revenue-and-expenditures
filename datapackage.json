      "value": "Generally, indicators reported are related to a given municipality's General Fund, as reported to the Office of Policy and Management. Intergovernmental Revenue counts any revenue received from other governments, including state, federal, and other municipal governments. This income may be part of grants, shared taxes, advances, cooperative or joint financing funds, or repayment for services rendered by one government for another. Other Revenue includes items such as licensing and user fees, and is calculated here by subtracting Property Tax Revenue and Intergovernmental Revenue from the Total Revenue. Total Transfers into General Fund includes revenue items the town includes in the budgeting process. Items that are not included in the budget, such as debt proceeds or bond refunds, are not included in this indicator, but are included in the Total Revenue including Other Sources indicator. Non-Educational Expenditures are calculated by subtracting Educational Expenditures from the Total Expenditures. Net Revenue is the surplus (or deficit) left after subtracting a municipality's Total Expenditures from its Total Revenue. Current Year Adjusted Taxes collectible are used in the calculation of an Equalized Mill Rate. State Fiscal Years run from July 1 through the following June 30. Population estimates used to calculate Per Capita measures were derived using the Connecticut Department of Public Health estimates as of July 1 of the year ending the State Fiscal Year - ie. SFY 2012-2013 uses the population estimate for July 1, 2013. For SFY 2013-2014, the town of Plymouth did not report to the OPM, therefore all values for that town and year are suppressed.",
